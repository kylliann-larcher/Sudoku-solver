# Sudoku Solver

## 📌 Description
Sudoku Solver is a Python program designed to automatically solve Sudoku grids using different algorithmic approaches, including:
- **Brute Force**: A naive approach that tests all possible combinations.
- **Backtracking**: A more efficient recursive technique that intelligently explores possible solutions.

The project is built using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** to ensure a clear and modular structure.

---

## 🚀 Features
✅ Load a Sudoku grid from a file or manual input.  
✅ Automatic solving using **Backtracking** and **Brute Force**.  
✅ Validity check for a move in the grid.  
✅ Clear display of the grid before and after solving.  
✅ Uses **numpy** for efficient matrix manipulation (optional).  

-### Code Structure
The project follows an **OOP-based structure**, making it modular and maintainable:
- `sudoku.py`: Contains the Sudoku board representation and constraints.
- `backtracking.py`: Implements solving algorithms (backtracking).
- `brute_force.py`: Implements solving algorithms (Brute Force).
- `sudoku_graphical_interface.py`: Manages the graphical interface with Pygame.
- `main.py`: Runs the application.
